# 🎯 F-Rank: Dungeon Targets

Welcome, Hunter. To advance to E-Rank, you must conquer the following topics and defeat practice quests under each domain.

---

## 🧠 1. Time & Space Complexity (Big-O Basics)
- Understand why time/space efficiency matters in large inputs
- Learn common complexities:  
  `O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n), O(n log n)`
- Calculate time complexity for loops and nested loops
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Predict time complexity of code snippets

---

## ⚔️ 2. Arrays (1D & 2D)
- Basic operations: traversal, insertion, deletion
- Left & right rotation techniques
- Prefix sums
- Fixed-size sliding window method
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Reverse array  
  - Maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)  
  - Move all zeroes to the end

---

## 🔠 3. Strings
- Understand string immutability
- Use hashmaps for character frequency
- Palindrome check (2-pointer technique)
- Work with substrings and anagram detection
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Reverse string  
  - Is palindrome?  
  - Longest substring without repeating characters

---

## 🧱 4. Basic Sorting Algorithms
- Implement:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Learn when to use each
- Know time/space complexity of each
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Implement each sort on small arrays and analyze

---

## 🧾 5. Hashing
- Use `HashMap` / `HashSet` (`unordered_map` in C++, `dict/set` in Python)
- Build frequency counters
- Detect duplicates
- Count occurrences efficiently
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Top K frequent elements  
  - First unique character in a string  
  - Array intersection

---

## 🔢 6. Basic Math for DSA
- Prime number check
- GCD & LCM (Euclidean Algorithm)
- Modulo arithmetic (important in large number operations)
- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes (optional advanced)  
  - Modular multiplication

---

## 📘 Optional / Bonus

### 🧩 Bit Manipulation Basics
- XOR
- Check even/odd using bitwise
- Swap two numbers without a temporary variable

- 🧪 **Practice**:
  - Find element that appears only once using XOR
